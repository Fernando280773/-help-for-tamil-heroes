# Help For Tamil Heroes - Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a community website for the Yorkshire Tamil Community, specifically designed to support former Tamil freedom fighters who were injured during the liberation struggle. The project combines Tamil cultural elements with modern web technologies.

## Key Considerations

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Always maintain respectful language when referring to Tamil liberation struggle
- Preserve Tamil text accuracy and cultural context
- Ensure proper Tamil typography and formatting

### Technical Standards
- Maintain responsive design principles (mobile-first)
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- Preserve Tamil font rendering (Noto Sans Tamil)

### Design Principles
- Keep the colorful gradient theme consistent
- Maintain glass morphism effects
- Preserve smooth animations and transitions
- Ensure Tamil text is clearly readable

### Code Structure
- HTML: Use semantic elements and proper Tamil lang attributes
- CSS: Organize styles logically, maintain gradient systems
- JavaScript: Keep functionality accessible and progressive enhancement
- Comments: Use both English and Tamil where appropriate

### Content Guidelines
- Tamil text should be authentic and properly formatted
- Maintain the community mission and values
- Keep humanitarian focus at the center
- Ensure contact information accuracy

## File Organization
- `index.html`: Main page with all sections
- `css/styles.css`: Custom styles and animations
- `js/script.js`: Interactive features and enhancements
- Assets should be organized in respective directories

## Browser Support Priority
1. Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
3. Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Accessibility Requirements
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

When making suggestions or generating code, please consider the humanitarian mission of this project and the cultural significance of supporting Tamil community members.
